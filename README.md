## My process

Follow the front-end mentor instructions and learn online when stuck on any section. Learn->Code->Run->Get error -> repeat. This is my process.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

After many days, I sat down at my desk and decided to clear my hand on the frontend. Based on thinking, I started this project and am willing to continue this process. This is a simple task but a good start for a newbie. In this project, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as a little bit of advanced concepts like Flexbox usage.

### Continued development

I took a challenge to sharpen my hands on frontend, which is why I will try more tasks from Frontend Mentor.

### Useful resources
